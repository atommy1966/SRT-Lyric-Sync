## üíª Local Development

This application is designed to get the Gemini API Key from an environment variable (`process.env.API_KEY`), which is automatically handled when deployed in Google AI Studio.

For **local development only**, you need to provide your key manually.

### 1. Create `local_env.js` file
In the project's root directory, create a new file and name it `local_env.js`.

### 2. Set Your API Key
Add the following content to `local_env.js`, replacing `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual Gemini API key:
```javascript
// FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY
window.process = {
  env: {
    API_KEY: "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
  }
};
```

### 3. Link the script in `index.html`
Open `index.html` and add the following line right before the `<script type="importmap">` tag:
```html
<script src="local_env.js"></script>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** This setup is for local testing only. **Do not commit the changes to `index.html` that include this script tag**, and **do not commit the `local_env.js` file**. Pushing these to a public repository will expose your API key.

### 4. Run a Local Server
This project doesn't need a complex build process.
- Open a terminal in the project's root directory.
- Use a simple local server. For example:
  ```bash
  # If you have Python 3
  python -m http.server

  # If you have Node.js and serve
  npx serve .
  ```

### 5. Open in Browser
- Navigate to the local URL shown in your terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
