## üíª Local Development

This application is designed to get the Gemini API Key from an environment variable (`process.env.API_KEY`), which is automatically handled when deployed in Google AI Studio.

For **local development only**, you will need to provide the key manually.

### 1. Set Your API Key (Local Workaround)
Because this is a simple static project without a build process, you must temporarily edit `services/geminiService.ts` to insert your key.

- **Open:** `services/geminiService.ts`
- **Find the line:** `const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY;`
- **Replace it with your key:** `const API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE";`

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** This is for local testing only. **Do not commit this change** or push it to a public repository, as it will expose your API key.

### 2. Run a Local Server
This project doesn't need a complex build process.
- Open a terminal in the project's root directory.
- Use a simple local server. For example:
  ```bash
  # If you have Python 3
  python -m http.server

  # If you have Node.js and serve
  npx serve .
  ```

### 3. Open in Browser
- Navigate to the local URL shown in your terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).
